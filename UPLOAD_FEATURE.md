# Document Upload via Claude Desktop

## ‚úÖ Feature Implemented

You can now upload documents directly through Claude Desktop using the MCP server integration!

## How to Use

### Option 1: Upload Local Files
If you have a file on your computer, you can upload it by providing the file path:

```
Use the upload_document tool with:
- file_path: "/path/to/your/document.pdf"
- category: "contract" (or invoice, report, email, presentation, other)
- process_immediately: true (to extract text and enable search)
```

### Option 2: Upload Base64 Content
For files that Claude has access to (like files you've shared), you can upload using base64 encoding:

```
Use the upload_document tool with:
- base64_content: [base64 encoded file data]
- filename: "document.pdf"
- category: "invoice"
- process_immediately: true
```

## Supported File Types

- **PDF** - Portable Document Format
- **DOCX** - Microsoft Word documents
- **TXT** - Plain text files
- **XLSX** - Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
- **CSV** - Comma-separated values

## Features

### Automatic Processing
- **Text extraction** from PDFs and documents
- **Table extraction** from structured documents
- **Vector embeddings** for semantic search
- **Duplicate detection** using SHA-256 hashing
- **Full-text search** indexing

### Size Limits
- Maximum file size: **50 MB**
- No limit on number of documents

### Duplicate Prevention
The system automatically detects duplicate documents using content hashing. If you try to upload the same document twice, it will notify you and show the existing document ID.

## Next Steps

After uploading documents, you can:
- Search for specific content using `search_documents`
